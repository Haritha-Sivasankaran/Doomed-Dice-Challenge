# Doomed-Dice-Challenge
Welcome to my GitHub page!

This project contains tasks based on dice which are solved using Java language

# Task - 1

How many total combinations are possible? Show the math along with the code!

# Task - 2

Calculate and display the distribution of all possible combinations obtained when rolling Die A and Die B together. Show the math along with the code! 
Hint: A 6 x 6 Matrix.

# Task - 3

Calculate the Probability of all Possible Sums occurring among the number of combinations from (2). Example: P(Sum = 2) = 1/X as there is only one combination possible to obtain Sum = 2. Die A = Die B = 1.

# Task - 4

Die A cannot have more than 4 Spots on a face. 
Die A may have multiple faces with the same number of spots. 
Die B can have as many spots on a face as necessary i.e. even more than 6. 

But to play your game, the probability of obtaining the Sums must remain the same! So if you could only roll P(Sum = 2) = 1/X, the new dice must have the spots reattached such that those probabilities are not changed. 

Input: 
Die_A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] 
Die B = Die_A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] 

Output: 
A Transform Function undoom_dice that takes (Die_A, Die_B) as input & outputs New_Die_A = [?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?], New_Die_B = [?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?] 
where, No New_Die A[x] > 4
